//  * This fucntion provides the caller with a simple plotting fucntion. If no further values are given 
//  * apart from the double array and the length of the array the function will autoscale the plot and

//  * plot is generated with the default values and the y axis will be autoscaled. If the min/max settings
//  * for the axis values will be set to 0.0, the whole plot will be autoscaled. The png parameter will
//  * save the file into a file named dislin.png where additional files will be saved in files named 
//  * dislin_1.png, dislin_2.png and so on. If the png flag is not set the file will be displayed on 
//  * the screen. The default resolution for the file is 1200x675. Th whole plot will be plotted with the
